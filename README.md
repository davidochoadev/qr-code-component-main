### What I learned

The most important thing I learned is the ability to create static pages using GitHub Pages. Throughout the development of this project, I embraced a mobile-first approach and incorporated root variables in the stylesheet, among other techniques.

I discovered that creating static pages with GitHub Pages offers numerous advantages. Firstly, it enables easy website publishing without the need to manage a server or worry about hosting. By creating a repository on GitHub and enabling GitHub Pages, the website can be made public effortlessly.

The mobile-first approach, which involves designing the website with mobile devices in mind and then adapting it for desktop devices, proved crucial. With the increasing number of people browsing the internet on their smartphones, ensuring that the site is well-optimized for mobile devices is essential.

Root variables, defined in the stylesheet using CSS custom properties syntax, provide a flexible way to manage common values used in website styling. For instance, by defining a variable for the main color and utilizing it throughout the stylesheet, modifying the main color becomes as simple as updating the value of the root variable. All elements utilizing the variable will automatically reflect the change.

Implementing these techniques significantly enhanced my ability to create effective and well-designed web pages. I am now proficient in crafting sites that adapt seamlessly to mobile devices, offering users a superior experience. Additionally, the use of root variables simplifies style management and promotes consistency throughout the project.

In conclusion, learning to utilize GitHub Pages for creating static pages, adopting a mobile-first approach, and incorporating root variables in styling has enriched my web development skills, enabling me to deliver high-quality projects.

```css
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
}
```
